# High-Level Design

This Javascript VM are designed to be running on memory constraint system such as MCU.
The diagram above shows the major components of berryjs: `Compact Byte Code Generator`
and `Virtual Machine` (VM). The `Compact Byte Code Generator` using https://github.com/swc-project/swc
to performs translation of input ECMAScript application into the `Compact Byte Code`
with the specified format (refer to [Compact Byte Code](#byte-code) page for details).
Prepared bytecode is executed by the Virtual Machine that performs interpretation
(refer to [Virtual Machine](#virtual-machine) and [ECMA](#ecma) pages for details).
